# My New Portfolio 🚀

This is my brand-new portfolio built with **React.js** and **TypeScript**.  
I crafted it with great care and attention to detail, keeping everything simple and clean.

## ✨ Features
- **React + TypeScript**: fully typed, reliable, and maintainable.  
- **No external libraries** except for [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) icons.  
- **Minimalist design** with a focus on clarity and smooth user experience.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- React.js  
- TypeScript  
- Lucide (for icons)  

## 📌 Goal
This portfolio is a personal showcase of my work, projects, and skills.  
It reflects my style: simple, functional, and thoughtfully designed.
